## Dataset
This document explores the Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing approximately 30,15,214 bike rides from FY2018 and 2017. The attributes included the trip start/end time, as well as additional measurements such as user type, gender, and age. 155K data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies in the birth date, which in some cases was dated prior 1900.
